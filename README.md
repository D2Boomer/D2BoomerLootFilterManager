# D2BoomerLootFilterManager
 
Special Thanks:
	- The team behind the game 'Last Epoch'. Their loot filter heavily inspired how this works.
	- Zezula (http://www.zezula.net/): The documentation on Storm.dll was heavily utilized. 
	- Elmegaard (https://github.com/Elmegaard/D2TxtImporter/tree/master): Referenced their library to see how they were ingesting the Diablo data files.
